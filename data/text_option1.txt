Then much later-about four or five years ago-I was on a long flight across the Pacific,
staring idly out the window at moonlit ocean, when it occurred to me with a certain
uncomfortable forcefulness that I didn't know the first thing about the only planet I was ever
going to live on. I had no idea, for example, why the oceans were salty but the Great Lakes
weren't. Didn't have the faintest idea. I didn't know if the oceans were growing more salty
with time or less, and whether ocean salinity levels was something I should be concerned
about or not. (I am very pleased to tell you that until the late 1970s scientists didn't know the
answers to these questions either. They just didn't talk about it very audibly.)

And ocean salinity of course represented only the merest sliver of my ignorance. I didn't
know what a proton was, or a protein, didn't know a quark from a quasar, didn't understand
how geologists could look at a layer of rock on a canyon wall and tell you how old it was,
didn't know anything really. I became gripped by a quiet, unwonted urge to know a little
about these matters and to understand how people figured them out. That to me remained the
greatest of all amazements-how scientists work things out. How does anybody know how
much the Earth weighs or how old its rocks are or what really is way down there in the
center? How can they know how and when the universe started and what it was like when it
did? How do they know what goes on inside an atom? And how, come to that-or perhaps
above all-can scientists so often seem to know nearly everything but then still can't predict an
earthquake or even tell us whether we should take an umbrella with us to the races next
Wednesday?
